# What is Machine Learning

If you are in the computer science field, you have probably heard of machine learning and how it is the next big thing. It seems that every new big discovery in computer science have been involving some kind of ML in the process. If you are anything like myself, you probably want to hop in the bandwagon and learn what machine learning is.  

Wikipedia defines machine learning as "the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead". This definition gives us a pretty good idea of what ML really is, but it doesn't give us the big picture. It doesn't tell us what to learn or how the algorithms fit together.

I like to view machine learning as a mean to solve real world problems. We combine our mathematical knowledge and our programming skills to create algorithm that will, indeed, solve our problem by finding pattern and using inference. But ML is more than just algorithms. It's an art. We don't throw any algorithm mindlessly and hope that it solves our predicament. No. There are different ways to solve the same problem. We have to understand the pros and cons of each algorithm by considering its accuracy and its speed. Our job is to choose the one that best fit our needs.  

Not only do we have to consider different types of algorithms, but we have to consider what type of problem we have, as different problem involves different process. We have to understand how the algorithm fits within that framework. Each problem can be classified in the realm of:

- DATA ANALYSIS: describe (what), diagnose (why), predict(future) and prescribe(what can we do) 
- TIME-SERIES: predict future outcome with time and data
- BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE: report business operation, risk management, supply chain, marketing campain, customer retention
- SENTIMENT ANALYSIS: associating meaning to a word or group of word
- COMPUTER VISION: extract information from digital images or videos to reproduce human vision.
- QUANT: forecast future risks, predict macroenconomic trends, predict stock market
- NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING: How a computer understand what we say (speech recognition) and respond back to us (vocal assistant)
- GAME THEORY: decision making in games
- FANTASY SPORT and ONLINE BETTING: assemble virtual team to win money
- SURVIVAL ANALYSIS: reliability analysis(engineering), duration analysis(economics), event history analysis (sociology)

# How to learn

Machine learning can be a daunting subject to learn, but with the right mindset, we can get the hang of it. 

The fisrt thing to learn is basic maths: calculus, linear algebra. I assume you are familiar with that. Otherwise, "Mathematics for Machine Learning" by Marc Peter Deisenroth is a great place to start: https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf

The second thing to learn is the algorithms. In the machine learning lingo, we refer to these algorithms as "models". Remember, our goal here is to assess the algorithm accuracy and speed by learning how it works.

Finally, once we are familiar with different types of model, we can learn how to apply them in real world problem. In this section, we want to understand the steps to solve that problem.

# Models

Machine learning models can be separated in 5 categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, neural networks, reinforcement learning and evolutionary comptuation. Each of these algorithm can be used to PREDICT, CLUSTER or CLASSIFY. Some are used specifically for DIMENSIONNALITY REDUCTION.

## SUPERVISED LEARNING

## UNSUPERVISED LEARNING

## NEURAL NETWORK

## REINFORCEMENT LEARNING

## EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION

- Genetic algorithm
